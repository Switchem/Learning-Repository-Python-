This repository contains coding exercises, projects, and notes as I learn Python and automation.

What I Learned from "Learn Python With This ONE Project" by Tech With Tim
I followed along with the tutorial by Tech With Tim on YouTube. Here's a summary of what I learned and how I approached it based on a comment from the video:

Follow the video and code along: I took notes as I went to help me remember key concepts.
Rewatch and rewrite functions in pseudocode: This helped me break down the more complicated functions by substituting numbers for variables to better understand how they work.
Have fun: Coding should be enjoyable, and I remind myself not to get frustrated if I don’t understand something immediately.
Skills Learned (as of 3/15/25):

Loops: I learned to use while and for loops, including how for loops work with variables and the break statement to stop loops.
If-Else Logic: I used if and else statements inside loops to control the flow.
Defining Functions: I learned how to define functions using def to organize code and return values.
Classes: I was introduced to the concept of classes, which define attributes and methods for objects. I also used the range class to generate random numbers in loops.
Validation and Constants: I used isdigit to validate integers and defined constants (variables in all caps).
Modules: I worked with modules like random to add randomness to my project.
String Interpolation: I used the f function to automatically convert integers into strings.
The return Statement: I learned how to use the return statement to send values back from functions.
This is a work in progress, but I’m excited to keep learning more about Python!
I'll keep you posted

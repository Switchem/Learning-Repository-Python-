# Learning-Repository-Python-
This repository contains coding exercises, projects, and notes as I learn Python and automation.
-----
I DID NOT DO THIS MYSELF I LEARNED FROM "Tech With Tim" on Youtube it was easy and fun to follow along on his video called "Learn Python With This ONE Project!"
and since someone from the comments said "For any beginners watching this. Here's how I made it easier to break down: 

1. Follow the video and code accordingly. 
2. Add notes as you go along for yourself (This can be comments in your code)
3. Re-watch the video the day after with paper and/or drawing tablet to re-write each function in pseudo code. 
 - Make sure to listen to his explanations of each function for clarification! 
 - The pseudo code will help you understand how the complicated functions work by allowing you to place in numbers instead of the variable names. 
4. Have fun. 
- Coding is not meant to be hell. Make it fun for yourself, change your environment when you need and remember it's not the end of the world if you don't get something because eventually you will!".
And that is how im learning python for right now!


Alright, so on 3/15/25 what I learned from this project was how to utilize/slash how to use loop cmds such as While, For where the only "loops" that I learned and know of as today
Building off the loops I got to see more of "if" and "else" used within the loops, also learn and was exposed to "for" and "else" loops. Cherry on top learned how to utilized the "break" to stop the loop.
I got to learn/touch on how to use variables with value repeatedly using the "for" and "in" loop
The coolest thing I tought was how many times variables was used again to make this slot machine work
Using the "def" to define the values, actions, inputs was a brain opener to me
I think I got the gist of the "append" method which stops the list
for the interface used alot of brackets im still wrapping my head around how it's still used for the interface and stuff
I got to use a class did not know what it was but from chatting with chatgpt it told me "It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have."
the classed the was used was range usually to generate random things, for my case numbers and was told it used commonly in loops majority of the time
and "isdigit" was used to see a the integer given was vaild. On top of that got to use a constant which is a variable just in all caps to say this does not change or should not be changed
Touched more on modules and how to import them such as "random" which can be used to generate randomness in your code from my understanding 
used the "f" function is used to help incorparate your integers automatically convert into your string
used the "return" statement is sent back value from a function
THIS IS WHAT I CAN REMEMBER SO FAR PART 2 of psuedo code/ more on how the rest of the script works later
